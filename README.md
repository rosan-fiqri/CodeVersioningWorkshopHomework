# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework

## Summary

This workshop covered the following Git and GitHub topics:

- **Git Basics:**
  - `git init`    : It's like saying, "Hey, Git, start keeping an eye on this folder for any changes I make."
  - `git add`     : Imagine you have a list of items, and you're selecting the items you want to pack in your bag for a trip.
  - `git commit`  : It's similar to taking a picture and writing a short caption to remember what you did.

  - `git push`    : It's like uploading your photos to a cloud service to share them with your friends.

  - `git branch`      : Imagine having different notebooks for different topics so you can keep your notes organized.
  - `git checkout`    : It's like flipping through the pages of different notebooks to focus on one specific topic.
  - `git checkout -b` : It's like opening a fresh notebook and beginning to take notes.
  
  - `git log`    : It's similar to checking a diary where you've recorded what you did on different days.
  
  - `git reset --hard Head~1` : It's like tearing out all the pages in your notebook after a specific point and starting over from there.
  - `git reset --soft Head~1` : It's like flipping back to an earlier page in your notebook but still having all your notes available to edit.
  
  - `git merge`  : It's similar to taking notes from two different notebooks and putting them together into a single notebook. 

- **GitHub Workflow:**
  - Creating Pull Requests (PRs)
  - Merging PRs
